### About Devfolio

  
Devfolio provides an **end-to-end hackathon platform** to help organizers host great hackathons by focusing on what matters most, i.e., hacker experience while Devfolio takes care of all the heavy lifting.  
The platform is the result of a need for intuitive tools to manage large-scale hackathons like [ETHIndia](http://ethindia.co), [wmn;](https://wmn.community) and [InOut](http://hackinout.co) \(5 editions so far\) handcrafted and organized by the Devfolio team. This, coupled with the lack of availability of a **unified and seamless** platform to manage hackathons, is the motivation behind unique features such as **‘Apply** **with a click’** and **hacker RSVP management**.

### Why Devfolio?

Organizing hackathons can get stressful pretty soon with organizers needing to juggle multiple tools and platforms apart from running logistics on the ground to bring it all together seamlessly for their attendees. Devfolio **replaces multiple tools/platforms** which organizers would need to use otherwise - Google Forms/Typeforms for applications, Mailchimp for sending emails, and GitHub/Devpost for project submissions. **Devfolio makes organizing hackathons a breeze!**

\*\*\*\*![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EC756F725F722BE94AD6EAF2936AE8E1CD7C7FCA9F39008B5476A130D7EE4B13_1566664179326_Screen+Shot+2019-08-24+at+9.59.16+PM.png)![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_DF39119415D48D75A41A3100993F6D58FD194B951BE3C3AAB4AD2039B88A3347_1566606204136_Screen+Shot+2019-08-24+at+5.52.01+AM.png)  


Easily **accept applications from your hackathon website**, **gather essential information** from hackers, and get **projects submitted on a publicly shareable link**. Devfolio also allows you to **leverage our vibrant, hacker community**. Get up to **double the number of applications** through the platform itself, from hackers who’re always on the lookout for new hackathons to participate in!

**Analyze and track application metrics**, **review profiles**, and **send hackathon invitations** with ease using **Devfolio’s powerful organizer dashboard**. The dashboard is packed with nifty features that organizers need, like **email announcements** and **logistics management**.

Organizers also get access to **1-on-1 office hours** with the Devfolio community team for advice on how to make the best use of the platform, along with insider tips and tricks by the Devfolio team, to host a memorable hackathon.

### Devfolio for Businesses

  
As a business, organizing hackathons can be an effective way to put the word out about your product in the developer community, collect feedback, and grow your team.  
On hosting a hackathon on Devfolio, businesses get **priority support**, help with **profile review** and **outreach**. You don’t need to have a hackathon website to start accepting applications with Devfolio. With a **dedicated Devfolio hosted subdomain,** you can get up and running within no time.

### Devfolio for University Students

  
We’re particularly interested in empowering student developers in India by enabling them to build engaged communities, at scale. We are happy to **provide the platform at no cost** to university organizers to help grow the hacker culture in universities. Devfolio brings with it the **best names in the industry** who not only offer mentorship and support to the hackers but **exciting API prizes** to incentivize them to build on cutting edge technology.  
Student organizers also get access to and **peer learning sessions** with past hackathon organizers for help with any queries about the process of hosting a great hackathon. We also ship out our popular **Devfolio T-shirts and stickers** for your hackers who’d love to get their hands on them!  
Please take a look at [Appendix A](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Organizer-Guide-Final-AlT3AP8Q6N_8XAFyKy0HVqmgAg-3JepEfZKESPQeiIjxuSbi#:uid=456290694918347088149875&h2=A:-University-Hackathons-On-bo) for the on-boarding process and [Appendix B](http://B:%20University%20Hackathons%20Terms%20of%20Engagement) for terms of engagement.

## Pre-Hackathon

### Planning scale/scope and timeline for your event

  
This is probably the first decision you’ll have to make. Hackathons come in many shapes and sizes. Any hackathon with upwards of 100 hackers in attendance and 24 hours hack period can be considered a legitimate hackathon in a conventional sense. This is recommended as a rule of thumb to follow for first-time organizers so that hacker experience can be focused upon. The upper cap in terms of hackers and time \(not more than 36-48 hours\) tends to depend upon the experience level of the organizing team in managing event logistics at scale and fundraising expectations. In case there is a good number of tech talks or speaker sessions planned, dedicated time can be set apart for them before the hackathon.   
Once you’re clear about the scale and scope of the event, you’ll have to work with an ambitious yet realistic timeline to organize a quality hackathon. Here’s a sample timeline: 



* **3 months before**
* * Figure out hackathon basics 
  * Prepare the budget
  * Organize your volunteer team



* **2.5 months before** 
* * Set up a placeholder website
  * Prepare your sponsorship brochure and start fundraising efforts
  * Apply to become a Devfolio Member hackathon



* **2 months before**
* * Kickoff off hackathon’s registrations on Devfolio
  * Outreach volunteer meeting
  * First wave of outreach



* **1.5 months before** 
* * Start reviewing and sending out hacker acceptances 
  * Second wave of outreach



* **1 month before**
* * Create hack day schedule and update website
  * Reach out to mentors/judges/speakers
  * Start announcing sponsors and speakers
  * Final wave of outreach
  * Second wave of hacker acceptances



* **0.5 month before**
* * Final volunteer meeting
  * Order prizes and hackathon schwag
  * Coordinate for sponsor schwag shipments

### Arranging hackathon basics: Venue/Food/WiFi

  
Figuring out and arranging the hackathon basics early on is essential to save yourself a lot of hassle and time down the road.  


**Venue**  
Should have enough space to seat all the hackers you intend to host comfortably. If the venue does not come with it, you’ll have to arrange **reasonably ergonomic chairs and tables** \(hackers will be spending most of their time on their workstations\) for the hackers along with **adequate power supply** and **plug points** for their devices.   
Make sure there are enough **washrooms** at the venue and ensure that they’ll be **regularly cleaned** during the hackathon. **Separate sleeping areas** for men and women should be designated in a **safe space** where **mattresses** can be provided for when they want to take a break from hacking. Please do not expect them to sleep at their workstations. You do not want to deal with grumpy hackers!  


**WiFi**  
**Uninterrupted WiFi** is the bare minimum that’s expected at a hackathon where hackers will be relying on the internet throughout, for building their hack. Make sure you plan for a **minimum of 2 devices per hacker**. WiFi should be open and accessible **without the need for proxy servers**. Create an **easy to recognize SSID** and **display WiFi credentials** at prominent locations through the venue. It’s a good idea to have **Ethernet** or **mobile internet devices** as backups in case of failure of the WiFi.   


**Food**  
For the long hours, they’ll be spending hacking, hackers deserve access to **nutritious** and **tasty** food. Don’t do Pizzas and Cola! No shortcuts here, please. Talk to local catering or restaurant services to finalize on a menu that will cater to a wide variety of tastes and dietary preferences. It’s usually a safe bet to go in for **non-spicy vegetarian food** only, in the **Indian subcontinent**, as it’s what a majority of the hackers will prefer and will save logistics hassle.   
You would need to provide **4 meals for a full day of hacking** - Breakfast, Lunch, High Tea, and Dinner. Arrange for a snacking session at midnight or keep for supplies like milk, cereal, bread, jam/butter. Also, keep snacks like biscuits, potato wafers, and chocolates for times of cravings.   
Unsurprisingly, a **regular supply of caffeine** will be required throughout the event, so make sure you arrange for a coffee dispenser. In India, having the option of tea would be appreciated. Energy drink companies like **Red Bull** and **Monster Energy** usually are happy to provide cans of their product at no cost in exchange for marketing deliverables. Do remember to advise hackers about **moderating their caffeine intake** through the event. 

### Building a great organizing team

  
A motivated organizing team is the backbone of a hackathon and is the invisible force that keeps the machine chugging along. It’s helpful to divide your team into smaller subteams with associated team leaders. The following are the teams you can create:  


* **Finance Team**: Takes care of budgeting for the entire event, management of cash flow throughout the event, leads negotiations with vendors and ensures payment of dues and reaches out to sponsors to secure sponsorship
* **Design Team**: Takes care of the design of brand, creatives, and website. 
* **Outreach Team**: Designs and executes social media strategy for the event, reaches out to hackers through alternate outreach channels like college administration emails, handles hacker queries through various channels and passes on hackathon information to hackers
* **Logistics Team**: Manages vendors and ensures proper arrangements have been made for the event, takes care of event management activities on event day like check-ins, swag distribution, food quality checks, etc.

  
Some advice that has worked out for us over the years:  


* Use a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) group to **manage all communications within the volunteer team** and keep everyone in sync
* **Hold regular conference calls** with the team to delegate responsibilities and for updates from all teams. [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) or [Zoom](https://zoom.us) can be used for this. 
* Use tools like [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Notion](https://notion.so) for **managing documentation** and **tracking tasks**

  
One of the advantages of using Devfolio is that you **don’t need to really need to have a dedicated technical team** for the hackathons since everything from registrations to final hack submissions is handled by Devfolio itself. Volunteers in the team with some development experience can **set up the placeholder website** and **integrate the** **‘Apply** **with Devfolio’ button** through a simple script within 5 mins.   
You can also use the **Devfolio public page** that is created for every hackathon and avoid having to build a website at all!   
You will need to designate a few members from your team with knowledge of the tech industry for **reviewing hacker applications** on Devfolio.   


### Hackathon Website and Branding

  
**Branding**  
Memorable branding is something hackers and sponsors come to associate your hackathon with. It’s essential to have a **consistent strategy** in this regard. It’s best to have someone with good design sense on your team **define the primary design guidelines** for the hackathon and ensure that it’s reflected in the logo, posters, and other creatives.   
Make sure you design graphics for **banners** \(include sponsor logos in them as per tier deliverables\) and **standees** \(some may be needed to define hacking zones, food zones, etc.\) to be kept at various locations throughout the venue.   
Hackathon **schwag** \(T-Shirts, Stickers, and other goodies\) are something hackers have come to expect at all hackathons they attend. Quirky designs and copy makes the schwag more memorable for hackers and encourages them to use them even after the event is over. This, in turn, leads to **better brand recognition** for your hackathon.   


**Website**  
One of the first metric through which hackers or sponsors decide whether a hackathon is worth their time is the hackathon website. Make sure it has all the information about your hackathon with sections such as:  


* **About** - Brief Introduction about your hackathon, information about past editions and theme of the hackathon, if any, and why hackers should apply to attend.
* **Tracks Section** \(Optional\) - Tracks are like guides to define some themes for hackers to build on. They are usually based on upcoming technologies or areas of interest like blockchain, AI/Ml, AR/VR, and Hardware.
* **Schedule** - A rough schedule can be provided in the initial days. Closer to the event, a more detailed schedule can be put out.
* **Sponsors** - Arrange the sponsor logos giving precedence in terms of size and position as per the sponsorship tiers.
* **Prizes** \(Optional\) - Mention the hackathon’s general prizes and the API prizes by sponsors to get hackers excited about attending.
* **FAQ** - Have a clear cut FAQ with questions that cover the most frequent queries of a hackathon that an attendee might have. Include the code of conduct, as well.
* **Links to Social Media** - Provide links to all your social media accounts.

  
It’s more important for your website to display the above information clearly than focusing on fancy UI elements. You can get inspiration for building an effective hackathon website by visiting the websites of popular hackathons around the world. Some websites on Devfolio illustrating the guidelines above are those of [InOut](http://hackinout.co), [ETHIndia](https://ethindia.co/), [Hack On Hills,](http://hackonhills.com) and [HINT](https://www.hackinthenorth.com/).

### Budgeting

  
Let’s take a look at the costs involved in organizing a 24-hour hackathon:  


* **Venue**: Should be free of cost if you’re organizing the hackathon as university organizers. Rents for commercial spaces vary as per the city.
* **WiFi**: Usually comes along with the venue. If not, you’ll need to buy or rent the entire WiFi setup consisting of access points, routers, switches, etc.
* **Food**: For a hackathon that will start around midday, expect to provide for 5 meals. Average costs in India would be Lunch/Dinner \(Rs.150\), Breakfast \(Rs.70\), and High Tea/Midnight Snacks\(Rs.50\) for a total expense of Rs. 470 per hacker
* **Mattresses**: A complete set consisting of a mattress, bedsheet, and pillow will cost about Rs.100 to rent in most cities. Aim to get enough to cover for half of the attending hackers. 
* **Schwag**: T-Shirts can be printed for about Rs.250-Rs.300 per piece \(we can introduce you to our vendors who can provide high-quality T-shirts at discounted rates\) and stickers will cost Rs.20 a piece from Indian vendors such as [InkMonk](https://inkmonk.com/categories/stickers/customizable-products/die-cut-custom-shape-sticker) 
* **Production**: These costs include standees, banners, projector rentals for presentation, tables, and chairs if required, etc.
* **Travel Reimbursement**: If your budget permits you can make it easier for outstation hackers to attend your hackathon by providing reimbursement equivalent to return rail fare from their location location. We suggest offering the average of sleeper and AC fare. 
* **Prizes**: You can either keep cash prizes for the top few hacks or order for cool gadgets and merchandise hackers would love to own. A good time to get these at discounted rates is during the shopping festivals on popular e-commerce platforms.
* **Miscellaneous**: This will cover everything not included above, like stationery/art supplies for the organizing team and other minor expenses.

### Fundraising

  
Fundraising is probably the most intimidating part of hosting a hackathon. It doesn’t have to be so if done right and with a healthy dose of optimism.  
**Sponsor Deck**  
A sponsorship deck is a concise document that allows sponsors to know more about your hackathon and informs them about ways to participate. Here is a structure that can be followed while designing a deck:

* Cover Page with hackathon logo, website URL, dates clearly visible. This is the page that creates the first impression. 
* Introduce the hackathon. Briefly mention the background of the organizers and experience with organizing hackathon or developer-focused events.
* Photos/Stats of past hackathons or developer events, if any.
* Logos of past sponsors. 
* Reasons to sponsor - mention benefits like developer engagement, brand visibility, and recruitment opportunities.
* Sponsorship Tiers - it’s a best practice to display the information in a tabular manner, clearly showing the difference between the different tiers.
* Contact information including social media links. 

  
**Sponsorship Tiers**  
Sponsorship Tiers should be in line with the budget expectations and taking into account how hackathons of similar scale in the region price their tiers. Mention the price in local currency/USD clearly next to the tier. Here is a suggested structure for the tiers:  


* **Platinum/Title**: Highest Tier with maximum brand visibility. The logo should be on top in the largest size on all outreach channels. Can offer logo to be put hackathon T-Shirts/ID Card/Certificates. Workshop of 45 mins. Include the benefits of lower tiers. Allow flyers/promotional material to be included in the swag bag.
* **Gold**: Logo can be smaller in size and placed below the platinum tier on outreach channels. The workshop duration can be 30 mins. Provide a dedicated sponsor booth in an area with good visibility. 
* **Silver**: Logo can be smaller in size and placed below the gold tier on outreach channels. The workshop duration can be 10 mins. Allow recruiters/company representatives to come onsite to interact with the hackers. 
* **Bronze/Partner**: Typically reserved for sponsors who offer only schwag at the hackathon. Logo size can be the smallest and be placed at the end. 

  
Add-ons to the tiers can be sponsor powered meals or sponsor powered initiatives.  
The key to successfully converting a sponsor through a cold email is personalization and brevity.

### Understanding Hacker application flow on Devfolio

  
Here’s how the application flow for a hacker applying to a hackathon hosted on Devfolio through the hackathon’s website would look like:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569354829332_Screen+Shot+2019-09-25+at+1.23.17+AM.png)![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569354887503_Screen+Shot+2019-09-25+at+1.24.20+AM.png)  


The hackathon’s website contains an ‘Apply with Devfolio’ button\(can be integrated with a script in 5 mins\). The button popups to allow the hacker to sign up for a Devfolio account or login to an existing one.

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569448599082_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.23.27+AM.png)![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569448650141_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.23.43+AM.png)  


On the next screen, extra questions asked by the organizer will appear. The hacker is marked as being having applied to the hackathon on answering the questions and completing the application. 

  
**Filling in the Devfolio Profile** 

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569449019542_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.31.43+AM.png)![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569449076554_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.34.22+AM.png)  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569449181111_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.35.20+AM.png)![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569449169562_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.35.44+AM.png)  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569449618270_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.43.01+AM.png)![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569449817927_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.46.29+AM.png)

The hacker is then led to the Devfolio hacker dashboard where he/she will need to complete their profile, filling out the information in different sections. We’ve ensured all the information needed has been covered through the fields asked for in the sections, as shown below.

  
**Team/Individual Profile Submission for Review**

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569450031211_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.49.40+AM.png)![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569450186393_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.52.48+AM.png)  


Upon filling in their profiles, hackers can then either submit their individual profile for review or join or create a team to submit the team profile for review.  
Upon submitting the profile for review, the hacker awaits the invitation to attend the hackathon.

### Devfolio Organizer Dashboard Breakdown

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569480868152_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+12.23.02+PM.png)

We provide organizers with a powerful organizer dashboard to manage their hackathons end-to-end. One of the ways in which we have made the dashboard flexible is by providing the ability to control access levels to varying amounts of information for the organizing team. Using the team tab in the dashboard, the organizer who has set up the hackathon can provide tab level access to different members of the organizing team.   
Here’s a breakdown of what functions of each tab:

* Overview: Includes all application stats.
* Review: Allows for hacker application review.
* Volunteer: Enables Check-ins on hackathon day.
* Admin: Contains advanced hackathon management features.
* Logistics: Tracks logistics of the hackathon, including T-Shirt size distribution and hacker travel tickets. Also provided access to the ‘fare’ tab.
* Fare: Records reimbursement cap for every travel location.
* Feedback: Displays feedback provided by hackers after the event is over.
* Team: Allows to add more organizers to the dashboard and defines tab level access for them.

### Hacker Outreach and tracking metrics using Devfolio

  
**Hacker Outreach**  
Hacker outreach strategies vary as per the channel. Here are the channels through which hackers can be reached out to:

* Twitter: The best way to build hype around your event. Original and quirky content that engages hackers works best here.
* Instagram: A close second to twitter, can take off with innovative use of stories.
* Facebook: Not as above as the above two for building the brand but targeted message on developer related groups works to increase visibility. Would advise to exercise caution as posting the same content and URL on multiple groups can lend to the URL being permanently blocked.
* College Email Outreach: Colleges all over the country are happy to forward emails to their students, which they think would be helpful for them. This is a great way to boost numbers. 

  
Once you are part of the Devfolio organizer community, you will be sent a sheet containing details of different outreach channels.

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569453264243_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+4.43.19+AM.png)  


The ‘Overview’ tab helps you track the results of your outreach efforts by providing application and profile submission metric for each day. This means if you see a spike in applications on a particular day, a specific outreach campaign has worked.

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569453407492_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+4.46.25+AM.png)  


Apart from the above, you can also track overall application stats and send reminders to submit profiles for review. 

### Reviewing Hacker Applications on Devfolio

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569453603336_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+4.48.05+AM.png)

The ‘Review’ tab is where you can review individual, and team profiles to extend invitations to them to attend your hackathon\(accept\), decline their application\(reject\) or waitlist them. You can apply various filters to help you in the process.

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569453618271_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+4.49.27+AM.png)

Here you can see all the relevant data required to make an invitation decision and accept/reject/waitlist them on the basis of it. Note that you are free to change your decision until you press the ‘Send acceptance email’ or ‘Send rejection email,’ which are irreversible actions. This is to enable batch-wise acceptance and rejection. On the contrary, marking someone as ‘Waitlisted’ immediately notifies them of their waitlisted status. 

### Managing Logistics using Devfolio

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569454436767_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.03.13+AM.png)  


If you are providing reimbursement to attending hackers, they will be asked to upload their travel tickets during the RSVP process, and the tickets will show up here along with their preferred repayment mode.

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569454079986_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+4.57.33+AM.png)

You find the T-Shirt size distribution here of ‘Submitted’ and ‘RSVP’ hackers, which is pretty useful while ordering Schwag.

 ![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569455288184_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.17.45+AM.png)

If you are providing travel reimbursement, the ‘Fare’ tab is where you can fill in the reimbursement amount for each of the locations hackers are traveling from. They will be shown the amount on their dashboard once they RSVP to attend the hackathon. 

### Advanced management using ‘Admin’ tab

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569455029970_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.12.34+AM.png)

The ‘Admin’ tab contains essential features that make it easier to manage your hackathon. You can extend the application and RSVP deadline for all hackers using the dashboard. 

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569455073104_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.13.00+AM.png)

All relevant data of hackers is visible through the dashboard itself. Certain sensitive information such as phone numbers is visible upon entering the username of the hacker in the search bar, which is why access to this tab must be provided with discretion. Only limited fields of data for RSVP hackers, as shown above, are available for export out of the dashboard. This will ensure that a reasonable level of privacy is maintained for Devfolio users.

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569455073089_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.13.17+AM.png)



The ‘Admin’ tab can be used to send announcements to hackers to keep them updated about information regarding the hackathon. Clicking a checkbox that appears on clicking on ‘Preview’ allows the announcement to go out as emails to the selected group of hackers.   
Once the hackathon is live, if hackers need more time to submit their project, the project submission deadline can be extended through the ‘Admin’ tab. 

### Office hours, peer learning sessions and reporting issues

  
Devfolio is much more than just a hackathon platform. Recognizing the need for providing a support ecosystem for hackers, we encourage hackers to participate in 1-on-1 office hours with the Devfolio team, which has vast experience in organizing hackathons. Please reach out to your community manager to book them for you. We also schedule conference calls with fellow organizers to provide you with useful advice regarding best practices while hosting a hackathon.As with any software platform, issues might arise while using the platform. While most of these might be minor confusions that can be easily clarified by the community manager, if you think you or a hacker is facing a bug, the right thing to do is provide as much relevant information as possible to Devfolio so that we can understand the root cause of the issue and fix it. The details can be sent to help@devfolio.co.  
Below is the bug report template to provide us the details in a structured manner:

* The device and OS on which the bug occurred
* The browser used along with browser version
* Devfolio username / email id
* Date and time at which it occurred \(optional\)
* Steps to reproduce \( optional \)
* Screenshots / Recording if available with the Console/Network tab in developer tools open \( you can use [https://www.getcloudapp.com/](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getcloudapp.com%2F) for this\)
* A detailed description of the bug or issue

## During Hackathon

### Check-ins on Devfolio

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569453868867_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+4.54.02+AM.png)

Devfolio provides an easy way to keep track of the attendees physically present at the hackathon. Only RSVP hackers will show up in the ‘Volunteer’ tab on entering their username or email.

 ![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569454657376_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.07.18+AM.png)

Once their profile shows up, as shown below, they can be marked ‘Check-in’ by the volunteer. Note that ‘Check-ins’ are an individual level process that needs to be undertaken for members of a team and individuals alike. 

### Submissions on Devfolio

All submissions made in a hackathon can be viewed publicly on the hackathon public page, as shown above.

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569510013901_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+8.29.14+PM.png)

A unique URL is generated for every submission by a team of hackers where they can describe the purpose of their project, challenges they faced, technologies used, add screenshots/video links, and links to their code.   
Here are some things to note regarding the submission process:  


1. Only teams who have been checked-in by your volunteering team will be eligible to submit their hack on Devfolio. The team leader will have the option to submit the hack active on his/her dashboard. Checked-in Individuals will have to join teams before the submission deadline to be able to submit their hack as individual submissions are not allowed.
2. They can click the button and submit their hack at any point before the submission deadline. Submissions are not editable once submitted and cannot be resubmitted, so that they need to be sure that there won't be requiring any changes.
3. They can fill in all the information as per the screenshot and submit their hack.
4. The hacks will start showing up publicly on [https://everest-hack.devfolio.co/submissions](https://everest-hack.devfolio.co/submissions). 
5. You can check [https://wmn.devfolio.co/submissions](https://wmn.devfolio.co/submissions) for reference, where 34 teams submitted their hacks.
6. If there are any particular API prize the hackers are submitting their hack for and you want to keep track of it, ask them to include it as a tag in the 'technologies used' section. 

### Suggested Judging process

  
Judging typically begins once submissions are made on Devfolio.   
Judges can be representatives sent by sponsors or industry resource personnel invited to attend the hackathon. Make sure to inform them well in advance so that they can spare time to make it to your hackathon. 

  
The judging process should be straightforward and do justice to the hackers’ efforts over the long hours spent building their hacks. It should be free from the undue influence of the organizers and avoid any bias in the interest of fairness. Since outstations hackers would have planned to leave shortly after the hackathon, the judging process should not take more time than necessary. Described below is a process that we’ve used ourselves and has been tested across the Devfolio hackathons. 

  
The organizer should call a meeting of all invited judges at least half an hour before the judging is scheduled to begin. During the meeting, the process should be clearly described to all the judges. The number of judges should ideally be proportional to the number of teams at the hackathon. Judging groups let the hackers get a holistic review of their hack. Judges can be paired with each other based on their strengths to form judging groups. For example, pair an engineer with a designer, product manager with a full stack developer, and so on. After submitting the projects on Devfolio before the submission deadline, the teams will set up the demo on their tables. Each team will be assigned a judging group, and the judges will visit their table. 

  
The team can use up to 5 minutes to describe their hack. They will have the opportunity to talk about what they built, why they built it, and demo how their project works. The team may talk about their project with a powerpoint presentation, but they still have to demo what was built.   
The judges will be rating each team on Technicality, Originality, Practicality, Aesthetics, and overall Wow Factor of the project. The judging groups will then be picking the best projects from the cohort they reviewed, giving a set of top teams as required. The judges can be provided a dedicated room with access to the presentation.

  
The top teams will be invited on stage during the closing ceremony, where they will again get 5 minutes to present their project on stage to all attendees and the judges. The judges can then independently judge all the hacks to come with the prize winners.

  
Devfolio Advantage: Judges can use the submission links to review the hacks on the public submissions page to refresh their memory during the normalization process.   
Sample Calculation:No. of Teams: 50No. of Judges: 10No. of Judges per Group: 2No. of Judge groups: 10/2 = 5No. of Hacks judged per Judge Group: 50/5 = 10Time per hack demo: 5 MinsTime taken for first round of presentation and judging: 5 \* 10 = 50 mins + 10 mins \(overshoot allowance\)No. of Teams called for second round judging per Judge Group: 2No. of on-stage demos: 2 \* 5 = 10Time taken for second round of presentations and judging: 5 \* 10 = 50 mins + 10 mins \(overshoot allowance\)Total time reserved allowing for delays = \(2 + 0.5\) = 2.5 hours

## Post Hackathon

### Collecting feedback on Devfolio

  
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569491796820_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.10.44+AM.png)  


Feedback is essential for the organizers to work on how to improve the next edition. Hackers will be notified to give their feedbacks once the hackathon ends. The feedback shared will start showing up in the ‘**Feedback**’ tab in the organizer dashboard.

  
Apart from the responses to the five feedback questions, hackers can also write reviews. These reviews are found in the ‘Reviews’ section. Maximum feedback should be collected as this can be an excellent opportunity for the hackathon to grow further in future editions.  


### 

### Wrap-up to-do’s

* Make sure to hand over the **prizes** announced to the winners.
* Announce the hackathon **winners** on social media platforms.
* Share the event photos with hackers and sponsors as soon as possible. The easiest way this can be done is through **Google Photos**. 
* Complete any pending commitments with sponsors, vendors, or miscellaneous people in due time.
