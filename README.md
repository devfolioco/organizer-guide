# Hackathon Organizer Guide

## About Devfolio

Devfolio provides an end-to-end hackathon platform to help organizers host great hackathons by focusing on what matters most, i.e. hacker experience while Devfolio takes care of all the heavy lifting.

The platform is the result of a need for intuitive tools to manage large-scale hackathons like ETHIndia, wmn; and InOut \(5 editions so far\) handcrafted and organized by the Devfolio team. This, coupled with the lack of availability of a unified and seamless platform to manage hackathons, is the motivation behind unique features such as ‘Apply with a click’ and hacker RSVP management.

### Why Devfolio?

Organizing hackathons can get stressful pretty soon with organizers needing to juggle multiple tools and platforms apart from running logistics on the ground to bring it all together seamlessly for their attendees. Devfolio **replaces multiple tools/platforms** which organizers would need to use otherwise - Google Forms/Typeforms for applications, Mailchimp for sending emails and GitHub/Devpost for project submissions. **Devfolio makes organizing hackathons a breeze!**
