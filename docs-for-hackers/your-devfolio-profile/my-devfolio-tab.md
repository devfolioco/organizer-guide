Once you add all the relevant data about yourself, Devfolio provides you with a Profile Page ðŸ‘‡

If your Devfolio profile is public, it can be viewed at `https://devfolio.co/@username`

{% hint style="warning" %}
"My Devfolio" will only be visible if you have not hidden your profile from public view.
