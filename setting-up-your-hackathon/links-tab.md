## Devfolio Microsite URL

If your hackathon doesn't have a website of its own, we've got you covered. Upon creating a hackathon on Devfolio, you're provided with a public page hosted at `your-hackathon-name`.devfolio.co

![A default slug is generated for you, with an option to edit it as per your preference depending upon the availability.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2811%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
`your-hackathon-name`will be your **Hackathon's slug**.
{% endhint %}

You can make announcements by sending out emails to the participants of your hackathon. The emails will be sent out through the email ID you provide in the `Contact Email` field.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you input a valid e-mail ID here.
