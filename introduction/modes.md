# üìÉ Hackathon Modes

### Devfolio offers three different hackathon modes 



| Hackathon Mode | Suitable For | Description | Review Process |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Offline | Organizers who wish to have control over who gets to submit projects at their hackathons | Well-suited for **on-site** hackathons | ‚úÖ |
| Online with Application Review | Organizers who wish to have control over who gets to submit projects at their hackathons | Just like `Offline`, it has the same application flow and project submission process with an application screening process | ‚úÖ |
| Online | Organizers who want anyone to be able to submit a project at their hackathon without any selection process | Leads to a larger number of project submissions trading off control over the projects' quality and a larger project submission judging overhead | ‚ùå |
