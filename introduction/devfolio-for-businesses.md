# Devfolio for Businesses

As a business, organizing hackathons can be an effective way to put the word out about your product in the developer community, collect feedback, and grow your team.  
On hosting a hackathon on Devfolio, businesses get **priority support**, help with **profile review** and **outreach**. You donâ€™t need to have a hackathon website to start accepting applications with Devfolio. With a **dedicated Devfolio hosted subdomain,** you can get up and running within no time.
