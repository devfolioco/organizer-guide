# Why Devfolio?

### Devfolio makes organizing hackathons a breeze.

Devfolio is the result of a need for intuitive tools to manage community hackathons like [ETHIndia](http://ethindia.co/), [wmn;](https://wmn.community/) and [InOut](http://hackinout.co/) \(7 editions so far\) handcrafted and organised by the Devfolio team. And now weâ€™d like to enable other hackathons as well to get to the next level with access to similar resources and our platform.
