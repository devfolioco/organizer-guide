# Hackathon Modes

Devfolio offers 3 hackathon modes in order to suit the organizer's needs.

* Offline
* Online With Application Review
* Online

| Hackathon Mode | Description | Suitable For | Review Process | Team Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Offline | Well-suited for on-site hackathons. | Organizers who wish to have control over who gets to submit projects at their hackathons. | ✅ | ✅ |
| Online with Application Review | Just like Offline, it has the same application flow and project submission process with appropriate copy differentiating them for the hackers. | Organizers who wish to have control over who gets to submit projects at their hackathons. | ✅ | ✅ |
| Online | Leads to a larger number of project submissions trading off control over the projects' quality and a larger project submission judging overhead. | Organizers who want anyone to be able to submit a project at their hackathon without any selection process. | ❌ | ❌ |

Once you've decided on the mode, it's time to start building your hackathon on Devfolio!
