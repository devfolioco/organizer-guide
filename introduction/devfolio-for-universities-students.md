# Devfolio for Universities students

We’re particularly interested in empowering student developers in India by enabling them to build engaged communities, at scale. We are happy to **provide the platform at no cost** to university organizers to help grow the hacker culture in universities. Devfolio brings with it the **best names in the industry** who not only offer mentorship and support to the hackers but **exciting API prizes** to incentivize them to build on cutting edge technology.  
Student organizers also get access to and **peer learning sessions** with past hackathon organizers for help with any queries about the process of hosting a great hackathon. We also ship out our popular **Devfolio T-shirts and stickers** for your hackers who’d love to get their hands on them!
