# Support and FAQs

## When can we access the Devfolio portal for registrations?

The Organizer Dashboard is visible as soon as your hackathon is verified by Devfolio. If you have submitted your hackathon for review, reach out to us at `community@devfolio.co` to learn the next steps.

## **Some participants missed their RSVP deadline and their status shows "Withdrawn". What should I do?**

You can extend the RSVP deadline in the Admin Tab, and send out an announcement to the accepted hackers to RSVP if they haven't yet. 

{% page-ref page="organizer-dashboard/admin-tab.md" %}

## **Can we extend the registration deadline after it starts?**

You can extend the application deadline from the Admin Tab in your Organizer Dashboard.

{% page-ref page="organizer-dashboard/admin-tab.md" %}

## **Can we extend the project submission deadline?**

You can extend the project submission deadline from the Admin Tab in your Organizer Dashboard.

{% hint style="warning" %}
But make sure to extend it before the initial submission deadline passes!

## **I cannot add teammates in my organizer dashboard.**

Only the creator of the hackathon has the permission to add teammates. The other members, even with all permissions, cannot add or remove teammates.

## **Can I change the fields present in the Application Form?**

If you haven't submitted your hackathon for review, you can make the changes by updating your hackathon.
