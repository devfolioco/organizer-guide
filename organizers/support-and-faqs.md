# FAQs for Organizers

## When can we access the Devfolio portal for registrations?

The Organizer Dashboard is visible as soon as your hackathon is verified by Devfolio. If you have submitted your hackathon for review, reach out to us at `community@devfolio.co` to learn the next steps.

## **Some participants missed their RSVP deadline and their status shows "Withdrawn". What should I do?**

You can extend the RSVP deadline in the Admin Tab, and send out an announcement to the accepted hackers to RSVP if they haven't yet.

## **Can we extend the registration deadline after it starts?**

You can extend the application deadline from the Admin Tab in your Organizer Dashboard.

## **I cannot add teammates in my organizer dashboard.**

Only the creator of the hackathon has permission to add teammates. The other members, even with all permissions, cannot add or remove teammates.

## **Can I change the fields present in the Application Form?**

If you haven't submitted your hackathon for review, you can make the changes by updating your hackathon.

## **Where can I view the submissions made to my Hackathon?**

You can find the submissions on your hackathon's microsite.

## How do I add Problem Statements to the Hackathon?

You can add it as a track to your hackathon via the `Prizes Tab`. This will enable the hacker to select the track if their hack is built around the problem statement.
