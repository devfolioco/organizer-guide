# ðŸ‘‘ Admin Tab

## Search Team and Hackers

All relevant data of hackers is visible through the dashboard itself.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Certain sensitive information such as phone numbers is visible upon entering the username of the hacker in the search bar, which is why **access to this tab must be provided with discretion**.
{% endhint %}

Upon searching the user, the following sub-sections appear

### **Info**

![Admin tab view in Online mode hackathon](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (64).png>)

### **Actions**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (65).png>)

### **Status**&#x20;

## Change Application Deadline

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png>)

Once the hackathon is live, if hackers need more time to submit their project, the project submission deadline can be extended here.

## Extend RSVP Deadline

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)

You can extend the application and RSVP deadline for all hackers using the dashboard. (RSVP is the time period in which the hacker once accepted needs to confirm his/her presence).\
For example, if you extend the RSVP Deadline by `N` days, it will enable the hackers to RSVP within `N` days from the instant you extend the deadline.

## Download CSV

### `Online` Mode

## Make an Announcement

The Admin tab can be used to send announcements to hackers to keep them updated about information regarding the hackathon. Clicking a checkbox that appears on clicking on â€˜Previewâ€™ allows the announcement to go out as emails to the selected group of hackers. You can choose the segment of hackers to notify to inform certain information relevant to those users only.

![Extra segments available in "Online with Application Review" and "Offline" Mode](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you wish to send out the announcement as an email (recommended), make sure you check the option to `Also send as email` before hitting send
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You **won't** be able to extend the submission deadline after your initial deadline has passed.
