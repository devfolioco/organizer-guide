If you are providing travel reimbursement, the â€˜Fareâ€™ tab is where you can fill in the reimbursement amount for each of the locations hackers are traveling from. They will be shown the amount on their dashboard once they RSVP to attend the hackathon.

You may decide how much you want to reimburse for different locations.
