## Using Built-in Fields for your Application

To help you save time, Devfolio provides you with built-in fields that are commonly used. You can decide what fields do the hackers need to fill in while applying for your hackathon.

![A variety of built-in fields available to select from and add to your application in an instant.](../../.gitbook/assets/application-p1.gif)

{% hint style="danger" %}
The fields selected here are marked as mandatory! If you want to make them optional, you can proceed to add them as a custom question.
{% endhint %}

Here's how it will look like when the hacker fills out the application to your hackathon.

At times, the hackers may have already added some fields such as GitHub, LinkedIn links to their profile. So when they start filling out the application, the available details are directly taken from their profile and are not asked again while they fill out the application. The ones not available are then explicitly asked for.

## Adding Custom Questions

{% hint style="info" %}
Pro Tip: You need not add custom questions for social media links if they're mandatory for your application since we have provided it in our pre-built fields
{% endhint %}

If you wish to create custom questions, you can proceed to do so by clicking on the `+ Add` button at the bottom. There are a variety of Field Types available to cater to most of your questions.

Make sure you check the `This is a required question` checkbox if you want to make the field compulsory
