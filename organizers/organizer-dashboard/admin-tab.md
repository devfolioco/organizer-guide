# Admin Tab

The Admin tab contains essential features that make it easier to manage your hackathon.

## Search Team and Hackers

All relevant data of hackers is visible through the dashboard itself.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Certain sensitive information such as phone numbers is visible upon entering the username of the hacker in the search bar, which is why **access to this tab must be provided with discretion**.

Upon searching the user, the following sub-sections appear

## Make an Announcement

The Admin tab can be used to send announcements to hackers to keep them updated about information regarding the hackathon. Clicking a checkbox that appears on clicking on ‘Preview’ allows the announcement to go out as emails to the selected group of hackers. You can choose the segment of hackers to notify to inform certain information relevant to those users only.
