We provide organizers with a powerful organizer dashboard to manage their hackathons end-to-end. One of the ways in which we have made the dashboard flexible is by providing the ability to control access levels to varying amounts of information for the organizing team. Using the team tab in the dashboard, the organizer who has set up the hackathon can provide tab level access to different members of the organizing team.   
Here’s a breakdown of what functions of each tab:

* Overview: Includes all application stats.
* Review: Allows for hacker application review.
* Volunteer: Enables Check-ins on hackathon day.
* Admin: Contains advanced hackathon management features.
* Logistics: Tracks logistics of the hackathon, including T-Shirt size distribution and hacker travel tickets. Also provided access to the ‘fare’ tab.
* Fare: Records reimbursement cap for every travel location.
* Feedback: Displays feedback provided by hackers after the event is over.
* Team: Allows to add more organizers to the dashboard and defines tab level access for them.
