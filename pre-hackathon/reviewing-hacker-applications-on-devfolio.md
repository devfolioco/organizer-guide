Here you can see all the relevant data required to make an invitation decision and accept/reject/waitlist them on the basis of it. Note that you are free to change your decision until you press the ‘Send acceptance email’ or ‘Send rejection email,’ which are irreversible actions. This is to enable batch-wise acceptance and rejection. On the contrary, marking someone as ‘Waitlisted’ immediately notifies them of their waitlisted status.
