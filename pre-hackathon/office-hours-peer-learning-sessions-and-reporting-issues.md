# Office hours, peer learning sessions and reporting issues

Devfolio is much more than just a hackathon platform. Recognizing the need for providing a support ecosystem for hackers, we encourage hackers to participate in 1-on-1 office hours with the Devfolio team, which has vast experience in organizing hackathons. Please reach out to your community manager to book them for you. We also schedule conference calls with fellow organizers to provide you with useful advice regarding best practices while hosting a hackathon.As with any software platform, issues might arise while using the platform. While most of these might be minor confusions that can be easily clarified by the community manager, if you think you or a hacker is facing a bug, the right thing to do is provide as much relevant information as possible to Devfolio so that we can understand the root cause of the issue and fix it. The details can be sent to help@devfolio.co.  
Below is the bug report template to provide us the details in a structured manner:
