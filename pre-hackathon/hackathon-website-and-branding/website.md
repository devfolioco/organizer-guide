# Website

One of the first metric through which hackers or sponsors decide whether a hackathon is worth their time is the hackathon website. Make sure it has all the information about your hackathon with sections such as:  


* **About** - Brief Introduction about your hackathon, information about past editions and theme of the hackathon, if any, and why hackers should apply to attend.
* **Tracks Section** \(Optional\) - Tracks are like guides to define some themes for hackers to build on. They are usually based on upcoming technologies or areas of interest like blockchain, AI/Ml, AR/VR, and Hardware.
* **Schedule** - A rough schedule can be provided in the initial days. Closer to the event, a more detailed schedule can be put out.
* **Sponsors** - Arrange the sponsor logos giving precedence in terms of size and position as per the sponsorship tiers.
* **Prizes** \(Optional\) - Mention the hackathon’s general prizes and the API prizes by sponsors to get hackers excited about attending.
* **FAQ** - Have a clear cut FAQ with questions that cover the most frequent queries of a hackathon that an attendee might have. Include the code of conduct, as well.
* **Links to Social Media** - Provide links to all your social media accounts.

  
It’s more important for your website to display the above information clearly than focusing on fancy UI elements. You can get inspiration for building an effective hackathon website by visiting the websites of popular hackathons around the world.
