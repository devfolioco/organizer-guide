![&apos;Admin&apos; Tab 1](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569455029970_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.12.34+AM.png)

The ‘Admin’ tab contains essential features that make it easier to manage your hackathon. You can extend the application and RSVP deadline for all hackers using the dashboard.

All relevant data of hackers is visible through the dashboard itself. Certain sensitive information such as phone numbers is visible upon entering the username of the hacker in the search bar, which is why access to this tab must be provided with discretion. 

Only limited fields of data for RSVP hackers, as shown above, are available for export out of the dashboard. This will ensure that a reasonable level of privacy is maintained for Devfolio users.

The ‘Admin’ tab can be used to send announcements to hackers to keep them updated about information regarding the hackathon. Clicking a checkbox that appears on clicking on ‘Preview’ allows the announcement to go out as emails to the selected group of hackers.

Once the hackathon is live, if hackers need more time to submit their project, the project submission deadline can be extended through the ‘Admin’ tab.
