# Understanding Hacker application flow on Devfolio

Here’s how the application flow for a hacker applying to a hackathon hosted on Devfolio through the hackathon’s website would look like:

The hackathon’s website contains an ‘Apply with Devfolio’ button\(can be integrated with a script in 5 mins\). The button popups to allow the hacker to sign up for a Devfolio account or login to an existing one.

![Extra Question 2](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569448650141_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+3.23.43+AM.png)

On the next screen, extra questions asked by the organizer will appear. The hacker is marked as being having applied to the hackathon on answering the questions and completing the application.
