If you are providing reimbursement to attending hackers, they will be asked to upload their travel tickets during the RSVP process, and the tickets will show up here along with their preferred repayment mode.

You find the T-Shirt size distribution here of ‘Submitted’ and ‘RSVP’ hackers, which is pretty useful while ordering Schwag. 

![&apos;Fares&apos; Tab](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569455288184_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.17.45+AM.png)

If you are providing travel reimbursement, the ‘Fare’ tab is where you can fill in the reimbursement amount for each of the locations hackers are traveling from. They will be shown the amount on their dashboard once they RSVP to attend the hackathon.
