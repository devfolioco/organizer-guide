# Planning scale/scope and timeline for your event

This is probably the first decision you’ll have to make. Hackathons come in many shapes and sizes. Any hackathon with upwards of 100 hackers in attendance and 24 hours hack period can be considered a legitimate hackathon in a conventional sense. This is recommended as a rule of thumb to follow for first-time organizers so that hacker experience can be focused upon. The upper cap in terms of hackers and time \(not more than 36-48 hours\) tends to depend upon the experience level of the organizing team in managing event logistics at scale and fundraising expectations. In case there is a good number of tech talks or speaker sessions planned, dedicated time can be set apart for them before the hackathon.   
Once you’re clear about the scale and scope of the event, you’ll have to work with an ambitious yet realistic timeline to organize a quality hackathon. Here’s a sample timeline:
