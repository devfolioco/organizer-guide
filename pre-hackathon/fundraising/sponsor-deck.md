# Sponsor Deck



A sponsorship deck is a concise document that allows sponsors to know more about your hackathon and informs them about ways to participate. Here is a structure that can be followed while designing a deck:

* Cover Page with hackathon logo, website URL, dates clearly visible. This is the page that creates the first impression. 
* Introduce the hackathon. Briefly mention the background of the organizers and experience with organizing hackathon or developer-focused events.
* Photos/Stats of past hackathons or developer events, if any.
* Logos of past sponsors. 
* Reasons to sponsor - mention benefits like developer engagement, brand visibility, and recruitment opportunities.
* Sponsorship Tiers - itâ€™s a best practice to display the information in a tabular manner, clearly showing the difference between the different tiers.
* Contact information including social media links.
