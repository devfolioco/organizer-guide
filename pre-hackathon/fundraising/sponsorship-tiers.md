# Sponsorship Tiers

Sponsorship Tiers should be in line with the budget expectations and taking into account how hackathons of similar scale in the region price their tiers. Mention the price in local currency/USD clearly next to the tier. Here is a suggested structure for the tiers:

* **Platinum/Title**: Highest Tier with maximum brand visibility. The logo should be on top in the largest size on all outreach channels. Can offer logo to be put hackathon T-Shirts/ID Card/Certificates. Workshop of 45 mins. Include the benefits of lower tiers. Allow flyers/promotional material to be included in the swag bag.
* **Gold**: Logo can be smaller in size and placed below the platinum tier on outreach channels. The workshop duration can be 30 mins. Provide a dedicated sponsor booth in an area with good visibility. 
* **Silver**: Logo can be smaller in size and placed below the gold tier on outreach channels. The workshop duration can be 10 mins. Allow recruiters/company representatives to come onsite to interact with the hackers. 
* **Bronze/Partner**: Typically reserved for sponsors who offer only schwag at the hackathon. Logo size can be the smallest and be placed at the end. 

  
Add-ons to the tiers can be sponsor powered meals or sponsor powered initiatives.  
The key to successfully converting a sponsor through a cold email is personalization and brevity.
