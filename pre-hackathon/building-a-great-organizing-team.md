# Building a great organizing team

A motivated organizing team is the backbone of a hackathon and is the invisible force that keeps the machine chugging along. It’s helpful to divide your team into smaller subteams with associated team leaders. The following are the teams you can create:  


* **Finance Team**: Takes care of budgeting for the entire event, management of cash flow throughout the event, leads negotiations with vendors and ensures payment of dues and reaches out to sponsors to secure sponsorship
* **Design Team**: Takes care of the design of brand, creatives, and website. 
* **Outreach Team**: Designs and executes social media strategy for the event, reaches out to hackers through alternate outreach channels like college administration emails, handles hacker queries through various channels and passes on hackathon information to hackers
* **Logistics Team**: Manages vendors and ensures proper arrangements have been made for the event, takes care of event management activities on event day like check-ins, swag distribution, food quality checks, etc.

  
Some advice that has worked out for us over the years:  


* Use a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) group to **manage all communications within the volunteer team** and keep everyone in sync
* **Hold regular conference calls** with the team to delegate responsibilities and for updates from all teams. [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) or [Zoom](https://zoom.us) can be used for this. 
* Use tools like [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Notion](https://notion.so) for **managing documentation** and **tracking tasks**

  
One of the advantages of using Devfolio is that you **don’t need to really need to have a dedicated technical team** for the hackathons since everything from registrations to final hack submissions is handled by Devfolio itself. Volunteers in the team with some development experience can **set up the placeholder website** and **integrate the** **‘Apply** **with Devfolio’ button** through a simple script within 5 mins.   
You can also use the **Devfolio public page** that is created for every hackathon and avoid having to build a website at all!   
You will need to designate a few members from your team with knowledge of the tech industry for **reviewing hacker applications** on Devfolio.
