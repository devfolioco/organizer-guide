# Hacker Outreach and tracking metrics using Devfolio

Hacker outreach strategies vary as per the channel. Here are the channels through which hackers can be reached out to:‌

* Twitter: The best way to build hype around your event. Original and quirky content that engages hackers works best here.
* Instagram: A close second to twitter, can take off with innovative use of stories.
* Facebook: Not as above as the above two for building the brand but targeted message on developer related groups works to increase visibility. Would advise to exercise caution as posting the same content and URL on multiple groups can lend to the URL being permanently blocked.
* College Email Outreach: Colleges all over the country are happy to forward emails to their students, which they think would be helpful for them. This is a great way to boost numbers.

 Once you are part of the Devfolio organizer community, you will be sent a sheet containing details of different outreach channels.

The ‘Overview’ tab helps you track the results of your outreach efforts by providing application and profile submission metric for each day. This means if you see a spike in applications on a particular day, a specific outreach campaign has worked.

Apart from the above, you can also track overall application stats and send reminders to submit profiles for review.
