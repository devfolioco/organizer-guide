# WiFi

**Uninterrupted WiFi** is the bare minimum that’s expected at a hackathon where hackers will be relying on the internet throughout, for building their hack. Make sure you plan for a **minimum of 2 devices per hacker**. WiFi should be open and accessible **without the need for proxy servers**. Create an **easy to recognize SSID** and **display WiFi credentials** at prominent locations through the venue. It’s a good idea to have **Ethernet** or **mobile internet devices** as backups in case of failure of the WiFi.
