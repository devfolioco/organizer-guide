# Venue

Should have enough space to seat all the hackers you intend to host comfortably. If the venue does not come with it, you’ll have to arrange **reasonably ergonomic chairs and tables** \(hackers will be spending most of their time on their workstations\) for the hackers along with **adequate power supply** and **plug points** for their devices.   
Make sure there are enough **washrooms** at the venue and ensure that they’ll be **regularly cleaned** during the hackathon. **Separate sleeping areas** for men and women should be designated in a **safe space** where **mattresses** can be provided for when they want to take a break from hacking. Please do not expect them to sleep at their workstations. You do not want to deal with grumpy hackers!
