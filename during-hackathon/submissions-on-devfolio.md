A unique URL is generated for every submission by a team of hackers where they can describe the purpose of their project, challenges they faced, technologies used, add screenshots/video links, and links to their code.   
Here are some things to note regarding the submission process:  


1. Only teams who have been checked-in by your volunteering team will be eligible to submit their hack on Devfolio. The team leader will have the option to submit the hack active on his/her dashboard. Checked-in Individuals will have to join teams before the submission deadline to be able to submit their hack as individual submissions are not allowed.
2. They can click the button and submit their hack at any point before the submission deadline. Submissions are not editable once submitted and cannot be resubmitted, so that they need to be sure that there won't be requiring any changes.
3. They can fill in all the information as per the screenshot and submit their hack.
4. The hacks will start showing up publicly on [https://everest-hack.devfolio.co/submissions](https://everest-hack.devfolio.co/submissions). 
5. You can check [https://wmn.devfolio.co/submissions](https://wmn.devfolio.co/submissions) for reference, where 34 teams submitted their hacks.
6. If there are any particular API prize the hackers are submitting their hack for and you want to keep track of it, ask them to include it as a tag in the 'technologies used' section.
