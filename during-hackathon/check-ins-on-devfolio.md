Devfolio provides an easy way to keep track of the attendees physically present at the hackathon. Only RSVP hackers will show up in the ‘Volunteer’ tab on entering their username or email.

Once their profile shows up, as shown below, they can be marked ‘Check-in’ by the volunteer. Note that ‘Check-ins’ are an individual level process that needs to be undertaken for members of a team and individuals alike.
