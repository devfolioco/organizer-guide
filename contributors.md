The Hackathon Organizer Guide is a collaborative effort between Devfolio and hackathon organizers who are part of our community. This guide serves as our mutual belief that hackers deserve to be able to attend well-organized hackathons and that you can still throw amazing hackathons whether it's your first or your hundredth hackathon.

A full list of community contributors to the Guide are listed below, in alphabetical order:
