# ðŸ“ƒ Hackathon Modes

\[TL;DR\] The hackathons on Devfolio are set up in one of the following modes:

* `Offline Hackathon`: This will be an on-site hackathon. Your application will be then reviewed and upon acceptance, you will have to be physically present at the venue. 
* `Online With Application Review`: Your application will first be reviewed by the organizer and you will be accepted/not accepted/waitlisted on the basis of that. Upon getting accepted, you will first have to RSVP yes, get checked-in by the organizers and then submit a project to the hackathon as a team. 
* `Online Hackathon`: Once you submit your application to the hackathon, you will be eligible to make a submission during the submission period without any review phase.

### Online Hackathon

* Just participate and jump to the dashboard
* Build and submit individually or as a team \(your wish!\)
