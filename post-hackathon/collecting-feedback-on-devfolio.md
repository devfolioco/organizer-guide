# Collecting feedback on Devfolio



![&apos;Feedback&apos; Tab](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48CFB91CDB7B3BBB2489F2A20A74BF3692FE7A02E6BCC36996FAF9D3342852FA_1569491796820_Screen+Shot+2019-09-26+at+5.10.44+AM.png)

  
Feedback is essential for the organizers to work on how to improve the next edition. Hackers will be notified to give their feedbacks once the hackathon ends. The feedback shared will start showing up in the ‘**Feedback**’ tab in the organizer dashboard.

  
Apart from the responses to the five feedback questions, hackers can also write reviews. These reviews are found in the ‘Reviews’ section.

  
Maximum feedback should be collected as this can be an excellent opportunity for the hackathon to grow further in future editions.
